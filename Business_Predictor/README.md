# ‚òï Latte Price Prediction in Top 5 Zip Codes

This project predicts latte prices in the top 5 zip codes using various machine learning regression models. The prediction is based on features like average income, population, and gender demographics per zip code.

## üéØ Objective

- Predict the price of a latte in different zip codes.
- Use regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.
- Apply predictions to the top 5 zip codes based on the dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)
